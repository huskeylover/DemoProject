# DemoProject
This project allows users to create register and account to a locally hosted server, login with the registered account, and then create to-do list. 

Ideally I should be able to fetch these to-dos later if I decide to login again. However, currently I am getting errors I am unable to resolve.    

Cheers to git and github
